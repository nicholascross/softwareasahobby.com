Most often this is because I want to learn more about a particular concept but it might also just be because I am interested to see what can be done and enjoy the challenge of working with new things.</p><p>I have heard it said that if you want to learn something then try teaching it. So with that thought in mind it seemed practical to create a website where I could layout out some of the different things I have been messing around with recently and try to explain them for others.</p><p>Even so this site is not intended to be place for great writing and easy to follow tutorials, so don't be disappointed when it falls short of that.</p><h2>Who is it for?</h2><p>I would be happy if any others find any of this content useful but primarily this site is for one person. Myself.</p><h2>When will this site be updated?</h2><p>This site will likely not see many updates as my main priority is to explore and have fun building things.</p><h2>How am I building this site?</h2><p>This site built using a static site generator called <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> which was written in Swift and open sourced by John Sundell. It would probably be good to write an article about it once I figure out how to use it properly.</p><p>ðŸ––</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/blog">blog</a></li><li><a href="/tags/idea">idea</a></li><li><a href="/tags/project">project</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
